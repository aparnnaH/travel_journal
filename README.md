### Recent product additions

- Organized app header with `Dashboard`, `Explore`, `Journal`, and `Account` groups.
- `Explore` dropdown includes Map, Passport, Travel Audit, and Companion.
- `Account` dropdown includes Profile, Friends / Travel Circle, and Sign out.
- Dashboard and Profile now surface Travel Circle without keeping Friends in the main header nav.
- Journal sharing prompts users to open Travel Circle when no friends exist.
- Travel Audit compares visited countries with passport stamp matches, missing map-stamp links, and still-locked stamp goals.
- Signed-in header shows the profile image or initials beside the account label.
- Profile completeness is hidden once the profile is complete.

## Feature Overview

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 11+
- Supabase project

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment

Copy the example file and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Required for the app:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

Optional for AI journal polishing:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_POLISH_MODEL=gpt-5.2
```

The example file still includes Instagram variables, but the current active app routes do not require them for the core map, journal, passport, friends, profile, dashboard, or companion flows.

### Supabase setup

The app expects Supabase auth plus profile and journal tables used by the existing services. For the friend and sharing feature, run:

```bash
supabase/friends.sql
```

That SQL adds:

- `friendships`
- `journal_shares`
- `journal_share_comments`
- indexes for friend/share/comment lookups
- row-level security policies for user-owned access

Run it after the base `profiles` and `journal_entries` tables exist, because the script references both.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If another dev server is already using port 3000, Next.js may choose the next available port.

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the Next.js dev server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run build    # Create a production build
npm run start    # Start the production server
```

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Optional AI companion polish endpoint
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_POLISH_MODEL=gpt-5.2

# Present in .env.local.example, not required by current core routes
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=
```

## API Routes

- `/api/profile` - profile read/update flow
- `/api/journal` - journal persistence
- `/api/journal/share` - replace/load journal share recipients
- `/api/journal/shared` - shared journal entries accessible to the current user
- `/api/journal/comments` - comments on accessible journal entries
- `/api/friends` - friendship summary
- `/api/friends/request` - create friend requests
- `/api/friends/[friendshipId]` - accept, block, or remove friendships
- `/api/ai/polish` - optional AI polish endpoint for companion drafts

## Notes for Future Work

- The user-facing Travel Audit page currently lives at `/compare`; only the label has been renamed.
- The app header intentionally groups secondary pages under dropdowns instead of placing every route in the main nav.
- Map and passport systems are connected through country/stamp matching but should remain loosely coupled.
- Friend sharing depends on accepted friendships and the `supabase/friends.sql` schema.
